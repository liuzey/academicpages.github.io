***Abstract:*** The wide adoption of deep neural networks (DNNs) in real-world
applications raises increasing security concerns. Neural Trojans em-
bedded in pre-trained neural networks are a harmful attack against
the DNN model supply chain. They generate false outputs when
certain stealthy triggers appear in the inputs. While data-poisoning
attacks have been well studied in the literature, code-poisoning and
model-poisoning backdoors only start to attract attention until re-
cently. We present a novel model-poisoning neural Trojan, namely
LoneNeuron, which responds to feature-domain patterns that trans-
form into invisible, sample-specific, and polymorphic pixel-domain
watermarks. With high attack specificity, LoneNeuron achieves
a 100% attack success rate, while not affecting the main task per-
formance. With LoneNeuronâ€™s unique watermark polymorphism
property, the same feature-domain trigger is resolved to multiple
watermarks in the pixel domain, which further improves watermark
randomness, stealthiness, and resistance against Trojan detection.
Extensive experiments show that LoneNeuron could escape state-
of-the-art Trojan detectors. LoneNeuron is also the first effective
backdoor attack against vision transformers (ViTs).
