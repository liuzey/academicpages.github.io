My name is Zeyan Liu. I’m currently a fourth-year CS PhD student at University of Kansas (KU) advised by Prof. [Bo Luo](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~bluo/) and Prof. [Fengjun Li](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~fli/index.html). I received my Bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics from Wuhan University in 2019. 

My research interests include security and privacy in AI and machine learning.
