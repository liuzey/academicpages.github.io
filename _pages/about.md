I’m currently a final-year CS Ph.D. student at the University of Kansas, advised by Prof. [Bo Luo](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~bluo/) and Prof. [Fengjun Li](http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~fli/index.html). I received my Bachelor’s degree in Math from Wuhan University in 2019. My research interests are within the broad areas of Cybersecurity and AI, including adversarial and privacy-preserving machine learning, AI SAFE (Safety, Accountability, Fairness, and Explainability), AI for Cybersecurity, and so on.

<p style="color: red;">
I am to join Boise State University as a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor in Fall 2024. I am looking for self-motivated students to join my group. Please contact me at {julianzy2024 AT gmail DOT com} if you are interested!
